Data Types in YAML

- Strings can be enclosed in single or double quotes, but it's not necessary unless the string contains special characters. 

Example
string: Hi, Folks!
integer: 18
float: 4.356
boolean: true
null_value: null
date: 2023-06-21
time: 12:00:00
list:
  - shoes
  - belt
  - tie
object:
  name: Rajneesh Maurya
  age: 18
  city: Lucknow

Multiline Strings in YAML

-YAML allows multiline strings.You can use a pipe character (|) to denote a literal block scalar, 
preserving line breaks, or a greater-than symbol (>) to fold the multiline string into a single line.

Example
about me: |
  I'm Rajneesh Maurya.

Nested Structures in YAML

-YAML supports nesting of data structures by using indentation. You can nest key-value pairs or create nested lists.

Example
person:
  name: Rajneesh Maurya
  age: 18
  like to do:
    - learning new things
    - sharing valuable thoughts
